# everything-canvas-webgl

Since I have been working in [@Brikl](https://www.github.com/brikl) as a studio software engineer, I have to learn a lot about DOM manipulation, BASIC canvas API, some stuffs which relate to 3d/2d. I'm really fun to work on that and usually have new challenge(**BUGS**) every days. Even though some bugs is hardly to solve for example SVG from merchant cannot render correctly in our studio, wrong position of placed 2d objects such Text, Image, it cannot stop me learn how to develop cool features and improve existing functionality to increase performance and reduce funny bugs. Untill now I had been working as a studio software engineer for one year. Sadly most of the time I used 3rd party library to solve those bugs untill I got an ticket about cannot change SVG color fill by using that 3rd party, I have no idea how to fix it because I always use that library to render SVG on 3D model. I had to go back to basic concept of DOM manipulation to fix something inside SVG element, Then I realize that I need more knowledge to develop harder feature in future(Soon). I dicussed with [Benz](https://github.com/benzdechapon) that I want to learn about WebGL, Canvas API, Real time rendering and Game development on web. That's why I created this repository to track my learning progress even though I have an archive repository from last year which I learn about ThreeJS, BabylonJS to build custom 3d shirt configurator which I can across about basic concept of BabylonJS with FabricJS. But I think it's not enough if I sill use library to develop. I decided to learn it from SVG, DOM, Canvas API, and WebGL.
